# A Javascript game using P5.js library

This game is an "endless runner" type game developed using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences. It was developed following the course offered by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) #ImersaoGameDev. Some changes are added, like the new class Sprite which handles the sprites and implements a method for creating the matrix for each character.

## Factory Pattern

One of the best patterns studied at this course is the Factory Design Pattern, which is implemented at the class Animation from which is possible to create both the main character as well as the game enemies.
