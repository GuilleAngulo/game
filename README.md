# A Javascript game using P5.js library

This game is an "endless runner" type game developed using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences. It was developed following the course offered by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) #ImersaoGameDev. Some changes are added, like the new class Sprite which handles the sprites and implements a method for creating the matrix for each character.
